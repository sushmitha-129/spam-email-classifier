- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer
- Logistic Regression

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Load real-world SMS spam dataset
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Convert text into numerical features using CountVectorizer
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate model accuracy
7. Test model with custom messages
